<h1>This is the Official Eggslut Dictionary</h1>
<p>Hi Josefina. First of all, happy birthday!! I am so happy to have you as my eggslut and I am so grateful that you were born hehe. Congratulations on being 21; you have some new freedoms now! But I know you will keep being a responsible eggslut. I hope your birthday will be as nice as your heart, as bright as your smile, and as wonderful as your butt. Ok that's kinda cringe. But anyways, I wanted to make an eggslut website, and I guess this is the start? Well, I love you so much. Te amooooo.</p>
<p>Eggslut: What we are. Boyfriend and girlfriend hehe. But so much more too. We are the only eggsluts and we are constantly evolving and growing.</p>
<p>Migration: Sometimes we transform into patos and migrate around and we love watching movies together</p>
<p>Osos: Besos are the best, and we have so many besos that they also come with osos.</p>
<p>Somosas: This is a new one. But we are the only two talking somosas and we somehow found each other.</p>
<p>On top of a tree: We are in love. We like trees and each other.</p>
<p>llllleeeeehhhhhhhh: The sound you make when we are toching tongues</p>
<p>Weird fishes: I don't know exactly what they are but they are the eggslut opps shm</p>
<p>SHM: SHM</p>
<p>Orangutan: Everyone else: the PDA enforcers</p>
<p>Gym mouse: We go to the gym sometimes, one day we will be gym rats.</p>
<p>Feta cheese: Cheeto feet get kinda stinky sometimes</p>
<p>Waffle: One of our favorite pasttimes with each other is yapping about our day through podcasts and whatnot.</p>
<p>I probably forgot some others, this website might be updated later.</p>
